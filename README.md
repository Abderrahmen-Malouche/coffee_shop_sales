# ☕ Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Dashboard

An interactive sales dashboard project built to analyze and visualize transactional data from a coffee shop using SQL and Power BI.

## 🔧 What I Did

- Cleaned and transformed raw sales data using SQL:
  - Converted and formatted dates and times
  - Fixed nulls, inconsistencies, and data types
- Built custom KPIs:
  - Total Sales, Orders, and Quantity Sold (monthly + MoM)
  - Daily performance metrics
- Designed an interactive dashboard in Power BI:
  - Trends over time
  - Sales by weekday vs weekend
  - Breakdown by store location, product category, and product type
